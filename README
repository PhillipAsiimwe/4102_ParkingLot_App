Computer Visions 4102 Final Project 
Parking lot application by Phillip AMANYA (101030494) Klaus CUMANI (101032429) Mohamed CAMARA (101028735) and Devin JN  PIERRE (100869993)
Program functionality: 
  Given a video of format .mp4 or .avi this application will then be able to track moving cars (Red rectangles), visualize vacant and non 
  vacant parking lots (Blue and White rectangles respectively). The Program needs a list of parking lots dependent on the video it is reading 
  if there exists a parking lot database the program will load it in other wise it will create a window where the user can map out all the 
  parking spaces that will be used. Press key 'q' when finished mapping out parking spots. 
  
It is a proof of concept for a more refined live parking lot monitor, which takes live video and outputs all the moving cars, where they have
parked and can locate free parking spots for a user to be assisted when parking. 

List of dependencies: (all these modules must be installed on python for the program to function)
  Detecto 
  TourchVision
  Numpy
  Opencv
  **Program file, Map_out_lot.py must be in the same directory
  **any saved numpy array files must be in the same directory 
  
-To run the program open command prompt and type "python Parking_App.py -v 'videos name plus extension' " ie Python Parking_App.py -v vid3.mp4 

*** IMPORTANT*** For the Detecto model to work please take the carmodel.pth file from cu learn and put it in the file directory, it was too
big to upload to Github, it is in the folder called required.
